# Gender and Age Detection using Machine Learning  

## Introduction  
This project implements a **Gender and Age Detection** system using machine learning techniques. Given an image of a person, the model predicts their gender (Male/Female) and estimates their age range. The system utilizes deep learning-based **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification.  

This project is beneficial for various applications such as **demographic analysis, targeted marketing, security systems, and social media enhancements**.  

### Features  
✅ Detects gender (Male/Female) from an image  
✅ Predicts age group (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.)  
✅ Uses deep learning models (CNN) for classification  
✅ Supports real-time detection via webcam or image input  
✅ Implemented in Python using OpenCV and deep learning frameworks  

### Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV for image processing  
- Deep Learning (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Pretrained models for feature extraction
